## 💼 Commercial Projects
- **Dusk Web Wallet**: 
I dove into the Web3 world as a Frontend Engineer at Dusk starting October 2023, working on the Web Wallet project. This cutting-edge tool tackles privacy in smart contracts, crucial for Dusk's 2024 Mainnet launch. We've crafted the Wallet using Svelte, focusing on top-notch code practices. Now, we're enhancing it based on user insights and gearing up for the Mainnet release. Plus, we've gone open-source, welcoming community contributions. [Explore Project](https://wallet.dusk.network)

- **Couchbase Capella**: 
At Couchbase, I contributed significantly to Capella, our DBaaS product, enhancing it on AWS, GCP, and Azure as a Product Front End Engineer. I took on leadership roles, guiding the product's strategic direction, including a tech stack shift from React to Svelte and onboarding new team members. Our innovations, like the AI-powered Capella iQ, helped earn the title of Best Cloud Data Management Solution for 2023-2024 by the Cloud Awards. My work played a part in Couchbase's financial uplift, with Capella boosting annual subscription revenue by 23% to $142.9 million in fiscal 2023. [Explore Project](https://capella.couchbase.com)
