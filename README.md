I dove into the Web3 world starting October 2023, working on Dusk's Web Wallet project. This cutting-edge tool tackles privacy in smart contracts, crucial for Dusk's 2024 Mainnet launch. We've crafted the Wallet using Svelte, focusing on top-notch code practices. Now, we're enhancing it based on user insights and gearing up for the Mainnet release.

At Couchbase, I contributed significantly to Capella, our DBaaS product, enhancing it on AWS, GCP, and Azure as a Product Front End Engineer. I took on leadership roles, guiding the product's strategic direction, including a tech stack shift from React to Svelte and onboarding new team members. Our innovations, like the AI-powered Capella iQ, helped earn the title of Best Cloud Data Management Solution for 2023-2024 by the Cloud Awards.
