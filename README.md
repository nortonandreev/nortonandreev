## üíº Recent Projects
- **BWRE Capital Bond Investment Platform**: 
I developed the official BWRE Capital website and the front-end for a bond investment platform that allows issuers to raise funds through bonds, investing proceeds in Money Market Funds and Italian Tax Credits. The platform integrates Dusk Network BV‚Äôs Dusk Token, offering tiered yield enhancements based on token holdings. Despite a tight timeline and the need to integrate third-party services like web3modal for crypto wallet management and Onfido for KYC and AML verification, the platform provides a seamless investment process with a dedicated Portfolio page. Designed for scalability, it showcases technical proficiency and a commitment to user-centric investment solutions. [Explore Project](https://bond.bwrecapital.com)

- **Dusk Explorer**: 
I played a key role in developing and launching the new Dusk's Block Explorer. This tool features an enhanced UI with charts, detailed transaction data, and node geographic overviews. Designed to run locally with a node, it offers real-time data collection and a dynamic activity dashboard. This project marks a significant milestone in enhancing blockchain transparency and efficiency, positioning our platform at the forefront of innovation.

- **Dusk Web Wallet**: 
I dove into the Web3 world starting October 2023, working on Dusk's Web Wallet project. This cutting-edge tool tackles privacy in smart contracts, crucial for Dusk's 2024 Mainnet launch. We've crafted the Wallet using Svelte, focusing on top-notch code practices. Now, we're enhancing it based on user insights and gearing up for the Mainnet release. Plus, we've gone open-source, welcoming community contributions. [Explore Project](https://wallet.dusk.network)

- **Couchbase Capella**: 
At Couchbase, I contributed significantly to Capella, our DBaaS product, enhancing it on AWS, GCP, and Azure as a Product Front End Engineer. I took on leadership roles, guiding the product's strategic direction, including a tech stack shift from React to Svelte and onboarding new team members. Our innovations, like the AI-powered Capella iQ, helped earn the title of Best Cloud Data Management Solution for 2023-2024 by the Cloud Awards. My work played a part in Couchbase's financial uplift, with Capella boosting annual subscription revenue by 23% to $142.9 million in fiscal 2023. [Explore Project](https://capella.couchbase.com)
